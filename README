OJUnit is a simple unit test tool written in and for Objective-J. It's based on the xUnit design.

Use the "ojtest" command line tool to run tests. For example, you can test CPDate in Cappuccino using the following:

    ojtest cappuccino/Tests/Foundation/CPDateTest.j

To run all tests in a directory (test-directory in this case):

    ojtest test-directory/*Test.j

Or to run all tests in a tree:

    find test-directory -name "*Test.j" | xargs ojtest
