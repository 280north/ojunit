OJUnit is a simple unit test tool written in and for Objective-J. It's based on the xUnit design.

For now, simply call the text based test runner using the "ojunit" interpreter. For example, you could test Date using the following

	ojunit cappuccino/Tests/Foundation/CPDateTest.j

or

  ojunit *Test.j

to get all tests in the current directory.
