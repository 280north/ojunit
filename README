OJUnit is a simple unit test tool written in and for Objective-J. It's based on the xUnit design.

For now, simply call the text based test runner using the "objj" interpreter, for example, from a Cappuccino checkout you could test Date using the following

	objj Tools/OJUnit/OJTestRunnerText.j Tests/Foundation/CPDateTest.j


Future work:

	- a web based test runner
	- easier way to run multiple tests
